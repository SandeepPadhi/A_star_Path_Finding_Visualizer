# A_star_Path_Finding_Visualizer
It is visualizer built using pygame that helps to visualize how A* algorithm proceeds for finding path from start point to end point in the grid.

Basically,we have a grid where we define start point and end point in the grid.
We also define the barriers in the grid that A* Algorithm have to cross to reach to the end point.

The project gives a visualization of how the A* algorithm wonderfully and speedily finds path from start to end point
